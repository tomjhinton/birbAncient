# birbStained

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was 'Ancient'.

I made a little model in blender and stuck some shaders on it. I'm nothing if not unpredictable.

# Blender Bit.
- Pretty simple modelling.
- Cell fracture to make some bits look ageing and crumbling.
- Wonder if that's what god has used to make me feel ever more ageing and crumbling.
- Curves turned into meshes for the plants.
- Shrinkwrap modifier on the vines.
- Gave Suzanne a body.
- Apparently she's based on the monkey from the end of Mallrats.
- Not seen that in a while, wonder if it holds up?



# Three Bit.
- Fireflies?Glowy things pretty much lifted from a lesson in [Bruno Simon's course](https://threejs-journey.com/)
- It wouldn't be coding if there wasn't a battle with some weird problem I didnt understand and this week was no different.
- Loaded in my texture and all my animals deiced to reorientate and position themselves.
- Worried I'd gotten so good at modelling, id crafted sentient beasts.
- Reached the point of just frantically googling "Why are you doing this to me?" & "Mrdoob, why hast thou forsaken me"
- Turns out a skinned mesh must have it's own material.
- No idea why.
- Thanks to[ discoverthreejs'  Tips & Tricks for finally solving it](https://discoverthreejs.com/tips-and-tricks/)
- As I write this I've got the animation player set up wrong so if you trigger the same animation twice before it finishes it gets confused as to where to reset to.
- I'm intending to fix that.
- It's really unlikely I have fixed that by now.
- If anyone knows about gltf animations and threejs plz help me.
- I mean I could just dig into the code but I confuse very easily. 


# Shader bit.
- Three similar shaders with some Math.random()'s in the uniforms which change when you click the title for the water/fluid/stuff.
- Warping coordinates and some noise basically
- [Thank you Stefan and Patricio for that noise](https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83)
